## 0.6.10

PINNED: traverse@0.6.9

### Patch Changes

Fix types for neotraverse/legacy. Now both CJS and ESM are properly typed. CAVEAT: ESM import in typescript doesn't provide `TraverseContext` and `TraverseOptions` types. Import that from `neotraverse` instead.

Fresh start. Check out the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ljharb/js-traverse/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v069---2024-04-08) 0.6.9 for a list of changes prior to this release.
